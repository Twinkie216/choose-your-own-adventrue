            <h1>Better lunch next time...</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You weren’t able to help yourself. You threw the door open and then screamed as something hit you, flinging you back into the wall.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything went dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Weeks later, you woke up in the hospital. “Where am I?” you asked softly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney was sitting next to you. He flipped through a book and smiled at you when you woke up. “Good morning sleepy head.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You gave him a repulsed look that made him laugh. It sounded like all the weight in the world was lifting off of his shoulders. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m so glad you’re okay,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What happened?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, when you got knocked out, I sent an emergency signal to our professor. It took a few hours to get a response, which was awful, but she finally got there and then she got you to a hospital.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are my parents here?” you asked meekly.
            </p>
            <p>
                He shook his head. “They’re at work. I feel responsible for this so I make sure to visit you before school everyday.” He was silent for a moment. “I’m sorry I got you hurt, Y/N. I never should have let you open that door.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s okay...I don’t know what came over me,” you admitted.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It was the jewel,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Did you get the jewel...?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney shook his head. “No, the tunnel collapsed. I was just lucky to get you out in time.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I sighed. “I’m so sorry.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Don’t be,” he said. “There’s no need to be sorry. I’m not done. I’ll fulfill my dream. Just you wait. But now, I have to go to school.” He patted your hand. “I’ll see you there soon, okay?”
            </p>
            <p>
                You smiled at him. “See ya soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
The End.
