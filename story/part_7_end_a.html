                I took Rodney’s and smiled as we walked forward to collect it. 

            </p>
            <p>
                “This feels right,” he said. “I’m so glad I have someone to share this moment with me. I know we used to be enemies, but you’re my best friend.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’d be flattered if it wasn’t so embarrassing,” I laughed. I nudged his shoulder, pushing down everything I felt on the inside. He laughed with me.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I know I didn’t think much of you yesterday, but you truly are an incredible spell caster and thanks to you, we’ll be able to make the world a better place.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “If you do me the honor of being my partner,” he said, “I’d love to go on many more adventures with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You smiled, all the jealousy and negativity collecting and dissipating inside of you. “Oh, Rodney, I’d love to go on more adventures with you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                And together, you grabbed the jewel, laughing as its power surged inside of both of you. It was exhilarating.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Together,” he promised, “we’ll make the world better.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Together,” you agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The End.
