                Rodney took a long time. And eventually you got tired of waiting for him. You snapped your fingers and a piece of mail popped up. You said, “Write SOS and fly to our professor.” The mail nodded and disappeared with a puff of smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                You waited for your professor to show up in her own puff of smoke. She looked deeply concerned. “I should have never sent my students if it was going to be this difficult,” she said. “Where is Rodney?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Inside.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You seperated?” she exclaimed.
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded, ashamed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She growled, but then softened up. “Let’s go find him.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You and your professor found him nursing a bad wound and in a flash you were both transported back to the school. You were in the science lab where you’d started, but the professor and Rodney were nowhere to be seen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Taking that as a sign, you washed out the bowl you’d left, threw away the trash and left for the day, hoping that Rodney was alright. If you could do it all over again, you never would have let him go in there alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                The End.
