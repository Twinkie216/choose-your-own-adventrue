            <hr>
            <p>
                You both ventured left, sure it would get you where you needed to go. Rodney scoped the area, collecting nerdy samples of leaves and grass and bark. Meanwhile, you looked at the sky and the leaves, mesmerized by how lush the nature was in this forest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You kept on moving until you tripped and stumbled into something soft and squishy.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh,” you exclaimed. “Rodney!” You looked around, searching for your adventurous partner. He broke through the brush and then halted before getting himself stuck. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “What are you doing?” he asked incredulously. “Get out of there!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t know how!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Use your spells,” he said, flabbergasted, almost exhausted that he had to tell you what to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                You grumbled at him for being a jerk and then said, “Light as a feather, up I go.” Except, you didn’t move. “Up I go. Up I go! Up I GO!” You kept sinking. Dread washing over your face. “Rodney, help me! Rodney, help me! Please!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney was panicking too. “Alright, alright! Just stay calm!” He threw you his bookbag and you grabbed the top, yanking and yanking and yanking. It was working! His backpack was getting drenched, though, and he was screaming at you, but you didn’t care, you pulled harder and then it ripped open, spilling out all of the contents. You gasped and tried to save it, but you accidently hit them down into the sand. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ahhhhh!” Rodney screamed. Frustrated, but too stubborn to leave you behind, Rodney stepped in and pulled you off the quicksand with the strength of a thousand cars. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your legs wouldn’t stop shaking. Suddenly, you were crying. “I want to go home,” you said. “I want to go home.” You wrapped your arms around yourself and shuddered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney sighed, feeling defeated as his research sunk into the quicksand, never to be seen again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dread washed over you both.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fine,” he said. “Spell our teacher. Send her letter through the void.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You listened to him and with a shaky snap of your fingers a piece of mail popped up. You said, “Write SOS and fly to our professor.” The mail nodded and disappeared with a puff of smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and Rodney sat down and waited for your professor to show up in her own puff of smoke. She looked deeply concerned. “I should have never sent my students if it was going to be this difficult,” she said. And she grabbed you and Rodney and with another puff of smoke, you both were back in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
                The End.
