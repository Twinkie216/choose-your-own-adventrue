            <p>
                You lean back in the chair and the nod slowly, a smile growing on your face. “You need me to complete this spell, don’t you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney nodded, not ashamed to admit that he needed help, which took the fun out of it. “Yes. You’re one of the best spell casters this school has. If you weren’t so ignorant to your history, I’d respect you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “History is boring,” you retorted. “Spells, on the other hands, are fantastic. So how do we begin?”
            </p>
            <p>
                XxX
            </p>
            <p>
                You’re sitting in class early the next day, and you smile as Rodney sits next to you. He gives you a questioning look as he unpacks his things.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why are you looking at me like that?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’ve been doing some thinking,” you said. “If you needed me to help you complete this spell, that means that you’re going somewhere. And I want to go with you!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He gave you a look and for a moment said nothing. “Fine,” he said, sighing.
            </p>
            <p>
                You gave him a look back. “That was too easy. I was prepared to fight you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He shrugged. “I was eventually going to ask because every other spellcaster at this school has been unavailable.” He opened a book and slid it in front of you. “I assume you want to know where we’re going?”
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded and looked down to a picture of a forest surrounding a mountain. You could barely make out a entertance at the base of the mountain. It was dark and ominous.
            </p>
            <p>
                He continued, “We’re going to Mildarasia. I’m going to need someone that knows how to cast spells.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is that south?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes,” he droned. “Very very south.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded and looked at the picture closer. “That’s awesome. So lemme look at that spell again?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “After class,” he said. “It’s about to begin.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You sat up straighter and looked at the professor. She may have hated you, but she could see you were on board and that made her smile.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good afternoon class~” she cheered. And just like that, class started. You couldn’t help but notice how exciting everything was starting to feel. You actually paid attention and to your surprise, you were learning about Mildarasia during class. You knew that the professor and Rodney had been coordinating this. That’s why she’d given him the folder. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After class, you and Rodney were called to the front of the classroom. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “I was told you’d like to join on our quest to find the Philosopher jewel,” she said. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You said, “Yes. If that’s what we’re looking for. The green one, right?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You weren’t paying attention?” the professor asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                You laughed. “No, no, I was totally paying attention.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney interjected, “She is one of the best spell casters at this school.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The professor sighed and then pushed a bag into Rodney’s hands. “This is everything you’ll need. Remember, Hemlock goes before Dragon’s iris.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You both nodded and headed out to the science lab. There, you unpacked everything in the bag and got to work on creating the spell.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is going to be one of the most complex spells I’ve ever worked on,” you said, excited. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney agreed. “I think she said they go in like this.” He lined up the items: Tail of unicorn, dragon iris, dried human eyes, frog leg, sulfur, and hemlock.
            </p>
            <p>
                You looked at the items and moved the tail of the unicorn to the end and...
