            <hr>
            <p>
                You both charged left and there were more pythons! In a flash you snapped your fingers and screamed, “Deflectus!” Armor materialized on you and Rodney’s bodies. He threw you over his shoulder and ran with a speed you never thought he was capable of. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When you both escaped the danger, he stopped, panting. He dropped you and dropped to all fours, exhausted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your legs wouldn’t stop shaking. Suddenly, you were crying. “I want to go home,” you said. “I want to go home.” You wrapped your arms around yourself and shuddered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney sighed, feeling defeated.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dread washed over you both.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Fine,” he said. “Spell our teacher. Send her letter through the void.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You listened to him and with a shaky snap of your fingers a piece of mail popped up. You said, “Write SOS and fly to our professor.” The mail nodded and disappeared with a puff of smoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                You and Rodney sat down and waited for your professor to show up in her own puff of smoke. She looked deeply concerned. “I should have never sent my students if it was going to be this difficult,” she said. And she grabbed you and Rodney and with another puff of smoke, you both were back in the classroom.
            </p>
            <p>
The End.
