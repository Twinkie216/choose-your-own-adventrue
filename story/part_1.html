                Y/N looked around and then set your head down. It was another boring day in magic class. Your professor was droning on and on about jewels all over the world. You could care less. You already knew what everyone else did: They were stupid powerful, rare jewels that brought catastrophy whereever they go.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Turn to page 31,” your professor called out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You shot your head up and followed directions, careful not to bring attention to yourself. Rondey next to you was scribbling away in his journal. He was going to get you in trouble again. He was a big Rhino humanoid made back when the world had accidently been flooded by the magical river, turning all animals into thinking humanoid beings and humans into magical beings. Another rare jewel catastrophe. He wasn’t magical like the other witches and mages in the room, but he was studying to become an anthropologist. He wanted to be a treasure hunter.

                You rolled your eyes watching him soak in everything the professor was saying. But eventually the professor’s voice slid into the background and your eyes grew heavy.
