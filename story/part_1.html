            <h1>And so it begins</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Y/N looked around and then set your head down. It was another boring day in magic class. Your professor was droning on and on about jewels all over the world. You could care less. You already knew what everyone else did: They were stupid powerful, rare jewels that brought catastrophy whereever they went.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Turn to page 31,” your professor called out. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Your head shot up and you followed directions, careful not to bring attention to yourself. The last thing you needed was to get kicked out of her class again for falling asleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rondey sat next to you scribbling away in his journal. He was going to get you in trouble again, somehow you just knew it. He was a big Rhino humanoid whose feet were loud and cumpy. His parents were made back when the world had accidently been flooded by the magical river, turning all animals into thinking humanoid beings and humans into magical beings. That was because of a rare green jewel, one that brought on creation and catastrophe. He wasn’t magical like the other witches and mages in the room, but he was studying to become a professional nerd. He wanted to be a grave digger or something and everyday in class he’d show up early and drag out all of his notebooks and notes and when class finally started, he’d lick up everything the professor said.
            </p>
            <p>
                You rolled your eyes watching him soak in everything the professor was saying. But eventually the professor’s voice slid into the background and your eyes grew heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly Rodney nudged you. “Y/N,” he whispered, “the professor is calling on you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You gasped when you noticed the whole class was looking at you. “Oh,” you groaned. “I’m sorry, what was the question?”
            </p>
            <p>
                The professor didn’t say anything, just pointed to the outside of the room and you made a noise between a groan and a growl. Not again!
            </p>
            <p>
                “No sleeping in the classroom, Y/N,” your professor scolded. “You know the rules. Sleep on your own time!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Defeated, you gathered your things and started to leave. It wasn’t your fault. The class was boring. Not everyone can or WANTED to be a treasure hunter brown noser type. You shot a dirty look at Rodney as you walked away from him and stopped at the door to throw back your bookbag.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you could exit, the students all started to pack up. The professor scoffed at their insubordination, but regarded the time on her watch and tutted.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I lost track of time,” she confessed, snapping her fingers and turning around to head back to her desk. “Class is over. Rodney, Y/N, come see me at my desk.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You and Rodney both groaned but trudged forward to the professor’s desk.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes, professor?” Rodney asked, smiling sweetly, trying to hide his confusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Rodney,” she greeted, smiling. She looked at me. “Y/N.” She sighed and then shook her head. “As we all know,” she said, her head leaning to the side, “Y/N hasn’t been doing well in the class.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I don’t think you’re allowed to discuss my progress with other students.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re failing, Y/N,” she said bluntly.
            </p>
            <p>
                You clamped your mouth shut and swallowed down the bitterness that rose to the back of your throat. “So?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “So, you’ll be working with Rodney here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “What?” Rodney sputtered. “But--”
            </p>
            <p>
                “But nothing,” the professor said. “I have a class average to maintain and you’re the best student and you’re the worst.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You coughed, choked at the idea that you were the worst. “I can’t be the worst,” you said. “There’s always Amy.”
            </p>
            <p>
                The professor shook her head. “Amy is doing quite well. She’s been doing better ever since her parents got her a tutor. Y/N, I know that this isn’t the most interesting class for some of the students here, but it is very important. I’m hoping that by pairing you with Rodney that you’ll be able to understand just what kind of impact these jewels can have on a society.” She looked at Rodney. “On a person.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Thank you, professor,” Rodney said. “It feels good to be called a person.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You rolled your eyes. “I still don’t understand why I have to be punished.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You’re not being punished,” your  professor argued. “You’re being helped.” She grabbed a folder off her desk and handed it to Rodney. “The dean said that you were looking for an internship or student employment of some kind. I’m sure that this qualifies. There are requirements in there that I’m sure you’re excited to meet.” And with a smile, your professor grabbed her bag and her coat. “I’ll be seeing you both tomorrow. You have until the end of this semester to improve her grade, Rodney. I’m counting on you.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodeny nodded excitedly, scanning over the pages in the folder. “You got it, professor!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He turned to you and shoved a test into your hands. “What’s this?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “A test. Follow me, we’re going to the library,” he said, walking off.
            </p>
            <p>
                School was over, and you felt like you had no choice, so you followed him to the library. He led you to the back and into a study room. He sat down at the chair and motioned you to sit, so you did.
            </p>
            <p>
                “What’s first?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                He set a map in front of you, which left you confused. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “What’s this?” You picked it up.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I have a proposition for you.” He pushed a spell in front of you and said, “I need you to help me complete this spell.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Why?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Because it means the adventure of a lift time," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                You looked over the spell, noticing different items that you needed were rare, but the general description caught your eye. “Is this a transportation spell?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney nodded. “Yes it is. Will you help me complete this spell?”
            </p>
