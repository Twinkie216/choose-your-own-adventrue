            <h1>Hands off</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You slapped his hand away and dashed forward, determined to get the power all to yourself. He didn’t deserve it! This was your chance at greatness! Finally, everything felt right!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before you could wrap your sweet fingers around the decadent green jewel, Rodney shrieked and tackled you. “You can’t touch it!” he screamed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s mine! I’m tired of listening to you!” you screamed. “You just want the power for yourself. You’re just selfish!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Stop, Y/N, this isn’t you! Please! Stop!” Rodney begged. “If you give into the impulses the jewel will pull you apart. If you weren’t so FREAKING stupid and paid attention in class you’d know that! Don’t give in!”
            </p>
            <p>
                You were afraid for a second before rage overcame you. “You’re just saying that to get the jewel all to yourself! Well I don’t believe you! Deflectus!” you shouted. Rodney flew off of you and back a few feet and you turned and launched yourself at the precious jewel.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney screamed, “Noooooo!”
            </p>
            <p>
                But it was too late, as soon as your fingers brushed the jewel it turned red and every fiber of your body screamed.
            </p>
            <p>
                And suddenly there was just...nothing...
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney screamed and screamed and screamed until he realized that there was nothing more he could do. You were just gone and so was the jewel, broken into a thousand pieces. He sat there, weeping. It would another thousand years or so before the jewel put itself back together. Finally, he sent word to his professor, who was just as heartbroken.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I never thought she would be dumb enough to touch it,” your professor lamented.
            </p>
            <p>
                She took Rodney home and they never spoke of the event again.
            </p>
            <p>
The End.
