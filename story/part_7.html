            <h1>Journey to the jewel</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Rodney put a hand over the door, making sure you couldn’t open it. After a second you realized that you’d placed your hand on the knob and were pulling on it. You let go as if it burned to touch and looked at Rodney, unsure of what had just happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s magical,” he explained, reading your face. “If it’s strong enough to phase you then we’re getting close.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “How come you weren’t affected?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney shook his head. “I still feel the jewel in here.” He put a hand over his heart. “It’s not behind this door, it’s down there, in that room. I can feel it. We’re getting close.” Tears filled his eyes. “We’re getting so close to my dream. So close, I can almost taste it.” He almost choked, he was so happy. He hugged you suddenly and your face burned red. “Thank you so much for agreeing to come with me! I know that I was being rude earlier but I really couldn’t have done this without you!”
            </p>
            <p>
                You put a hand on Rodney’s back. “I’m so happy that I can help you accomplish this.” You patted his back and then moved away from the door, outside of his arms, feeling conflicted. Deep inside of you, you wanted to be happy for him. He was going to get the jewel and make the world a better place. And even though you weren’t there for everything, you were helping him do that. You, despite all your years coasting by, were finally a part of something bigger than yourself. And for some reason, instead of feeling happy, you felt jealous. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney was a nerd, a dork, a loser. He always had his nose in a book. He always did the right thing. There was no way he’d abuse the power if he got it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, something inside you wanted it for yourself. You had no idea what you’d do with a power as great as that, but you at least knew that you could cast spells. There was nothing stopping you from also doing good things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Slowly, you followed behind Rodney as he strode forward, happily pushing towards his prize. A prize that could be YOURS. You felt so conflicted. You hate how he walked, so proud of something he couldn’t do alone. So happy that he had completed his dreams before he even had his hands on the jewel. So confident in himself when he needed YOUR help to get there in the first place!
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the cave split open and beyond them was a vast pit. “We’ll have to jump down,” he said. “Could I have some help?”
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded. “Light as a feather, down we go,” you said. You hopped off the cliff and Rodney hopped after you, laughing as you both floated down. The further you floated down, the brighter the place seemed to go. It was so green. There were green crystals shimmering all along the walls. They descended slower as the crystals got bigger until they reached the floor of the cave again. You snapped your fingers and you both fell for a second to the floor. It didn’t phase you. Miraculously, you’d appeared right in front of the jewel. Rodney was gasping, completely enthralled.
            </p>
            <p>
                “This is it,” he said. “We made it.” He looked at you and stuck out his hand. “Want to help me collect it?” His eyes looked so hopeful.
            </p>
            <p>
                You looked from his eyes to his hand and then...
