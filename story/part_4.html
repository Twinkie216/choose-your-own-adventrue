            <h1>Attacked from the sky</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You went right and walked for a while, growing incredibly ansty. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wow,” you said, exasperated. “That mountain isn’t getting closer!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney didn’t say anything. He was too busy surveying the land. He looked from the map to the trail. He was snatching leaves here and there, putting them in a tiny plastic bag. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “What are you doing?” you asked, annoyed.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Collecting leaves.” He sighed and pushed the bag towards you. “I’m going to research them later. I think it’s fascinating. Look at how different they are.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You look at the leaves and then smile. “They’ve got this really cool green shine to it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think it’s from the jewel’s influence," he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “But it’s all the way in the mountain,” you said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “You can’t feel the power in the air?” he asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                You shook your head. “Can you?”
            </p>
            <p>
                He nodded. “I feel it right here.” He put a hand on his chest and looked up to the mountain. “I feel connected to this jewel.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You were silent for a moment. “Is this the jewel that cause the catastrophe?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yes,” Rodney said. He smiled. “It’s been my dream to find the jewel and bring good to this world.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wow, Rodney. I had no idea that you wanted to help the world so much,” you said, laughing. “I think it’s great that you’re so passionate about all of this.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think if you paid more attention in class it could be something that you’d be passionate about too. Spells can be even more fun when you know the history behind them. The whole world looks different, more special, when you know what it used to look like and you can see how far society has come.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You smiled at Rodney and then gasped. “Rodney, look out!” you screamed!
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney ducked as a python launched itself from a tree, fangs blaring. “Run, Y/N, run!” he screamed, pushing you forward. You ran away, screaming more and more as more pythons started falling from trees. Suddenly the path forked. 
            </p>
            <p>
                You went to run left, but Rodney pulled you back. You both stopped for a second.
