            <h1>Base of the mountain</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You charged forward and Rodney pushed you forward more, finally, he picked you up and threw you over his shoulder, dashing forward. “I can’t let you slow us down!” he screamed, bulldozing through the forest. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Let me down, you pervert!” you yelled. “Let me go! I can run on my own!” You kicked your feet, your face bright red. You threw a fit and when the coast was clear, he dropped you on your butt and looked around. You were at the base of the mountain. The wall of rock and stone had a beat down path, traveling up the side towards the opening in the mountain. It felt cold just looking at it.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We’re finally here,” Rodney said, smiling.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Rodney, if you think you can treat me like this, then you’re wrong!” Rodney’s smiles faded as you waved your arms around furiously. “I came here with you so that way I could have fun and go on an adventure and maybe even get some extra credit to help not fail our history class! But if you think that you can man handle me with your crazy Rhino strength, then you’ve got another thing coming, buster! Another thing coming!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney shook his head and put the map in front of your face. “Just look,” he said. “We’ve arrived.” You smacked the map out of your face. He rolled his eyes. “I am sorry that I violated some boundaries, but due to the sky raining FREAKING snakes, I thought it was appropriate to get us out of there as soon as possible. Despite your magical powers, you’re not very good at spellcasting under pressure. Since you didn’t react fast enough, I had to step in.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You huffed. “Well.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well?” he countered. “I let you come because I thought you’d be helpful. But you haven’t done much the whole trip.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s not fair!” he retorted. “I have absolutely no direction! I hadn’t read the files! I haven’t been pulling this together for however long you have! I don’t have all the answers!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m not saying that you have to have all of the answers,” he responded. “I’m saying that you’re not pulling your weight. I told you before we left that we needed an experienced spellcaster and so far you’ve failed me.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “This isn’t all about you,” you said. “This is about the jewel. What are we even getting it for?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I told you, it’s always been my dream to bring good to the world by obtaining its power,” he said.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Whoa, you never said anything about power. What kind of power does it have?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney just groaned. “It would be so much nicer to talk to you if you weren’t such a bum at history.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Your face flooded with the heat of embarrassment. “You know what, Rodney, you’re a jerk!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He ignored you and started to walk away. “Whatever, Y/N, I’m going to go get the jewel. You’re free to come with me or stay here. Either way, I’ll be going.”
