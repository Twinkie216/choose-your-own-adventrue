            <h1>Ops! It backfired!</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                You moved the dried human eyes to the front and then started chanting. Suddenly, smoke began to rise and wrap around you and Rodney. You both chanted harder until it felt like you were being pulled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Suddenly! You both fell down, a tangle of arms and legs, and cried out in pain and confusion. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “What happened?” you coughed. “Where are we?” You looked around and shook your head. “I’ve never been here before.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney groaned and pushed you off of him and moved away. “We’re on the third floor of the library. In the geography section,” he said grumpily. “I can’t believe you messed this up! It took MONTHS to get those ingredients and YOU failed us!” He picked up a book and threw it out of anger, which shocked you. You’d NEVER seen Rodney this upset before. It would have hit against the wall, but a bright blue tentacle shot out and snatched it, gently wrapping the book up to the chest of the old, wrinkly chest of the head librarian. Her office door was open and she gave you and Rodney a dirty look.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Library is closed!” she hissed. “Go home and don’t hurt my books!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney slumped his shoulders. “I’m sorry, Mrs. Octavia.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Mrs. Octavia huffed in response and went to her office and shut the door.
            </p>
            <p>
                You sat up from the floor and looked around. How had you gone to school here for so long and not even known that there was a library, let alone a third floor? You tried to reach out to Rodney, but he backed away. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Good luck with you semester,” he said, close to the verge of tears. “I hope you fail.”
            </p>
            <p>
                He stormed away, leaving you speechless and feeling guilty. You kicked at a wall and waited a few moments for him to get a head start before you followed him out. (You had to follow him because you were lost.)
            </p>
            <p>
                When you both exited the library you went home and pretended nothing ever happened.
            </p>
            <p>
                The End.
