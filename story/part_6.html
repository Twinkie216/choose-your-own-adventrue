            <h1>Into the darkness</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Aggravated that he was going to leave you, you screamed, “Wait a minute! You can’t ditch me!” You stomped up to him and crossed your arms. “I’m coming. You could use me in the tunnels. It’ll be dark in there.” You shivered looking up at them. “And probably cold...”
            </p>
            <p>
                You both trekked up the side of the mountain, carefully dodging loose pieces of rock as they fell from under your feet. The wind picked up, pushing back your hair. You walked behind Rodney, more than willing to let him (literally) take the fall if anything were to happen.You stepped over plants and small webs. You slipped a bit as you reached the narrow incline at the entrance of the cave. Rodney stuck out his arm, pushing you back to the mountain, making sure you didn’t fall.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Be careful,” he whispered. “It is only going to get harder from here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded, your previous irritation melting away. “What’s the plan?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “We’re going to enter and find the jewel,” he said simply, but he didn’t even sound sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Is there a map of the cave somewhere in your folder?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No, but from what I’ve gathered, it’s a fairly straight forward cave.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You paused for a moment to think. “Oh, then there are booby traps.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney nodded. “Tons of them apparently. Good thing for us is that so many other people have been here before that there shouldn’t be too many left. I know you don’t normally pay attention in class, but a few years ago someone actually got close enough to the jewel to take a picture, so we should be okay as long as we’re careful.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You nodded. “I can be careful.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney didn’t say anything and instead moved forward, voyaging through the tunnel, his eyes sharp and searching. “I’ll need some help. I can’t see anything.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh!” You stepped forward and said, “Illuminous.” And a bright yellow ball grew in front of you and Rodney, lighting up the tunnel. It grew bigger until you snapped your fingers and then it raced to float above your hand. “This is good, right?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney smiled. “That’s perfect! Great job! Third year spell!” He moved to your side and kicked a rock down the path, satisfied when it set off a trap. Teeth sprouted from the wall and flung across the walls. Rodney looked at you. “I hope you have a spell to deflect that. Deflectus or something?”
            </p>
            <p>
                You laughed, poshly, feeling good that there was something that you could be useful for. “Actually, I’ll just snap my fingers and turn the outer coat of our skin harder than stone, so those things will bounce off us.” True to your word, you snapped your fingers and said, “Outer protection spell.” Within a second the air around your skin was pulling tightly into a stone cover all over your bodies. Rodney looked all over his body, making sure that nothing was left exposed. You looked with him, sure your spell had worked, but passively humouring him. You didn’t get an A in spells for three years to mess up a protection spell.
            </p>
            <p>
                You both walked forward and when the teeth shot out, you stuck up your hand and said, “Deflectus.” The spikes bounced off the invisible wall you’d created. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney said, “Show off. You could have just done that to begin with.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “You have no idea how capable I am,” you shot back. “If this is my one chance to show you up, I’m going to take it.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You both moved forward, deflecting obstacles as they came until you came across a closed door. You both stopped to observe it, curious if it was a trap. In the distance you could see that the cave opened up to a larger room, which could have been a drop off. You weren’t sure which was to go.
