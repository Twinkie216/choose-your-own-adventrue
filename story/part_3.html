            <p>
                You shook your head and moved the dragon’s irises behind the Hemolock. “Professor said that the hemolock goes before the dragon iris!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney shook his head. “I got too eager to complete the spell that I forgot.” He sighed. “My bad. I’m glad we have such a highly skilled spellcaster here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You smiled, feeling your cheeks begin to tint, and then started to chant the words. Rodney joined in one by one you mixed the ingredients together until piles of smoke danced off the counter and enveloped the two of you. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a sudden tug, you were pulled into the smoke and sat out into the forest. You both fell over, a mess of arms and legs.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m sorry,” you said, pulling your arm out from under him. “I didn’t know that it would be so forceful!”
            </p>
            <p>
                He pushed you off and stood up. “I didn’t know either.” He looked around. “Did you have the entrance of the cave in mind when you chanted the spell?”
            </p>
            <p>
                You shook your head as you stood up. “No, just the mountain.” You looked around. “It’s just over there. It’s huge. Wasn’t the door part way up the mountain? Was I supposed to picture us at the cave of the entrance?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney let out a groan and a growl. “Of course! Why would we go all this way to not show up at the cave!”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well I don’t know, don’t you think you have said something beforehand?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney growled, but then composed himself. “Nevermind. Little oversight. At least we’re here.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah, all we have to do is walk up there.” You started to walk forward and then stopped. “We have a map right?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney pulled the map out of his back pocket. “Yes, but it’s not geographical.” He unfolded it and you took a look. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Where are we?” you asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rodney sighed, but then said, “Here.” He looked around again and again and then asked, “So which way do you want to go?” He pointed left and then right. “Both ways get there.”
            </p>
            <p>
                You looked at the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well, since they both lead to the mountain...” Both sides had paths that were thick with underbrush.
