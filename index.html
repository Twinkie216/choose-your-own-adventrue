            Looking for a story about a girl that goes on a magical adventure? You've come to the right place!
        </h3>
        <p>
            You're just a typical girl at a typical school and everything seems to be going okay. You've got friends, you've got decent grades, you just can't seem to get your history class to be interesting at all. After constantly being caught sleeping in class and being kicked out your professor gives you an ultimatum! Either you study and bring up your grade this semester or you fail her class! And to make it worse, there's another condition. You HAVE to study with your nemisis, Rodney the Rhino, the biggest history buff you know.
